# Project_Froebel_Huang_Kelly

We all know how preventable yet rampant gun violence has been over the years and how much it has affected communities all over the states. As a result, we will be analyzing a dataset that dates back to 2014 and covers
all gun violence incidents in the U.S. to the end of September 2021. This dataset is from the Gun Violence Archive website where “incidents collected from over 7,500 law enforcement, media, government and commercial sources daily in an effort to provide near-real time data about the results of gun violence”. More details about the source can be read here: https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/about



Questions we will be exploring:
1. A state’s gun violence vs. National gun violence statistics

2. What are the states with the most incidents (injured and killed) due to gun violence?
  a. Are there states that have more injuries but not deaths? Vice versa?
  
3. What are the cities with the most incidents (injured and killed) due to gun violence?
  a. Are there cities that have more injuries but not deaths? Vice versa?
  b. How does a city and its state compare in gun violence incidents?
  
4. What dates/time period do most gun violence (deaths or injuries) occur generally?
  a. How does the date affect gun violence? Does it have any effect in general?
  b. Does the date affect the mortality rate of victims in a gun violence incident (i.e.
  are victims more likely to be injured than killed if it’s around the summer, etc.)?
  c. Are there cities/states that differ from the general time period of frequent gun
  violence incidents? How so?
